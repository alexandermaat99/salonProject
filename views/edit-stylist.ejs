<!-- This HTML document represents a view for editing stylist information. It is typically used within a web application or 
system to allow administrators or users to update a stylist's details. The page includes a responsive layout with external style 
sheets and script imports for consistent styling and interactivity. The page begins with a heading, "Edit Stylist," indicating 
its purpose. It contains a form that is pre-populated with the current data of the stylist to be edited. The form fields include 
first name, last name, and potentially other fields (not shown here) that are essential for a stylist's profile. Hidden input 
"stylistId" is used to store the identifier of the stylist being edited. Each input field is labeled and includes a value attribute 
filled with the current data from the stylist's record in the database. This allows users to see the existing information and make 
changes. The form also includes a "Submit" button for updating the stylist's information.
Below the form, there is a link to navigate back to the admin page, providing an option to cancel the editing process and 
return to the administrator's dashboard.-->
